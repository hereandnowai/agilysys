# Day 2: Modern Frontend Development with Angular

Welcome to Day 2! Today we dive into modern frontend development using Angular framework, while continuing to leverage GitHub Copilot for enhanced productivity and learning.

## 🎯 Day Overview

Building on yesterday's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript foundation, today we'll explore Angular - a powerful TypeScript-based framework for building dynamic web applications. You'll learn how Copilot can accelerate Angular development and help you understand complex framework concepts.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Morning Session (2 hours)
- **Angular Fundamentals**
  - TypeScript introduction
  - Angular CLI and project structure
  - Components and templates
  - Data binding basics

- **Development Environment Setup**
  - Node.js and npm configuration
  - Angular CLI installation
  - Project scaffolding with Copilot

### Afternoon Session (2 hours)
- **Component Architecture**
  - Creating and organizing components
  - Component communication
  - Services and dependency injection
  - Routing basics

- **POML (Prompt Oriented Markup Language)**
  - Introduction to POML for AI-assisted development
  - Writing effective prompts for Angular development
  - Automating repetitive tasks

## 🚀 Projects

### Project 1: My First Angular Project
**Location**: `./agilysys-day-2-my-first-angular-project/about-us-for-agilysys/`

Build your first Angular application with Copilot assistance.

**Objectives**:
- Set up an Angular project from scratch
- Create multiple components
- Implement basic routing
- Style with modern CSS

### Project 2: POML Quick Start
**Location**: `./quick-start/`

Learn to use POML for enhanced AI-assisted development.

**Objectives**:
- Understand POML syntax and capabilities
- Generate Angular components using POML
- Automate development workflows
- Practice advanced prompt engineering

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Completed Day 1 exercises
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Angular CLI installed globally
- GitHub Copilot active in VS Code

### Installation Steps
```bash
# Install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli

# Verify installation
ng version

# Navigate to day 2 folder
cd agilysys-day-2

# Install project dependencies (if any)
npm install
```

### Development Environment Check
1. Ensure Angular CLI is properly installed
2. Verify GitHub Copilot is active
3. Check that TypeScript support is enabled in VS Code

## 📋 Learning Checklist

By the end of Day 2, you should be able to:

- [ ] Set up a new Angular project using Angular CLI
- [ ] Understand TypeScript basics and syntax
- [ ] Create and organize Angular components
- [ ] Implement data binding (interpolation, property, event)
- [ ] Use Angular services for business logic
- [ ] Set up basic routing between components
- [ ] Use GitHub Copilot for Angular-specific code generation
- [ ] Write and execute POML scripts
- [ ] Apply component-based architecture principles

## 🎓 Expected Outcomes

After completing Day 2, you will have:

1. **Angular Foundation**: Solid understanding of Angular framework basics
2. **TypeScript Proficiency**: Comfort with TypeScript syntax and features
3. **Component Architecture**: Knowledge of how to structure Angular applications
4. **POML Experience**: Ability to use POML for automated development tasks
5. **Working Applications**: Two functional Angular projects

## 🔄 What's Next - Day 3 Preview

Tomorrow we'll focus on:
- **Unit Testing** with Jasmine and Karma
- **Test-Driven Development** practices
- **Code Quality** tools and linting
- **GitHub Copilot** for test generation

## 💡 Pro Tips for Angular Development

1. **Use Copilot for Boilerplate**: Let Copilot generate component templates, services, and modules
2. **Leverage TypeScript**: Use type annotations to get better Copilot suggestions
3. **Component Comments**: Write descriptive comments to guide Copilot's understanding
4. **POML Automation**: Use POML scripts for repetitive Angular CLI commands

## 🛠️ Common Angular CLI Commands

```bash
# Create new component
ng generate component component-name

# Create new service
ng generate service service-name

# Serve the application
ng serve

# Build for production
ng build

# Run tests
ng test
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
- **Node version conflicts**: Use Node v18+ for best Angular compatibility
- **Copilot not suggesting Angular code**: Ensure you're in a TypeScript file with proper extensions
- **POML execution errors**: Check the `pomlruns/` folder for detailed execution logs
