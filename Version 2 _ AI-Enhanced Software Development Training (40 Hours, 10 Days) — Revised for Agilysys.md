## **10-Day Detailed Program Schedule (Angular)**

### **Day 1: Copilot Kickoff & Angular 16 Fundamentals — from zero to shipping in 4 hours**

* Hands-on setup: scaffold a new Angular 16 project with standalone APIs.

* Enable Copilot Agentic Mode, generate a commit plan before coding.

* **Mini Project 1:** Build a **User Profile Manager** with standalone component, reactive form validation, localStorage persistence.

* **Prompt recipes:**

  * "Create a standalone Angular 16 component named user-profile with a reactive form for name/email/role, persisting to localStorage. Provide a commit plan first."

  * "Generate Jest unit tests for form validation edge cases."

* **Deliverables:** Working profile editor, tests green, PR auto-generated by Copilot.

### **Day 2: Components, Services & Routing — autonomous multi-file build**

* Generate nested components with Angular 16 best practices.

* Implement service injection using DI patterns.

* Setup routing with lazy loading.

* **Mini Project 2:** Build a **Task Manager** with routed views for task list/detail.

* **Prompt recipes:**

  * "Goal: Implement a Task Manager with task service, lazy-loaded routes, and a routed detail view. List plan, then proceed after I type 'go'."

* **Deliverables:** Task CRUD works, lazy loading confirmed, PR merged.

### **Day 3: Forms & RxJS — catalog feature end-to-end**

* Work with **Reactive Forms** and **Template-driven Forms**.

* Handle async data streams with RxJS operators (debounceTime, switchMap).

* **Mini Project 3:** Build a **Booking Form** with live validation and async availability check.

* **Prompt recipes:**

  * "Create bookingService with checkAvailability(dateRange) returning Observable."

  * "Generate async validators for reactive form using debounceTime(300)."

* **Deliverables:** Booking form validates asynchronously; state persists.

### **Day 4: Group Project 1 — Multi-file Feature Creation (team build)**

* Split developers into squads; each squad owns a vertical slice.

* **Project:** Build an **Employee Management Dashboard**:

  * Squad A: Authentication \+ Guards

  * Squad B: Employee CRUD service

  * Squad C: Department filters

  * Squad D: Notifications with RxJS Subjects

  * Squad E: Role-based routing & interceptors

* **Prompt recipes:**

  * "Plan a multi-module implementation for Employee Dashboard with 5 squads. Generate task breakdown, file changes, and test stubs."

* **Deliverables:** Baseline dashboard functional; coordinated PRs with Copilot summaries.

### **Day 5: Testing with Jest & Karma — production-style coverage**

* **Unit Testing with Jest:** Services, business logic, validation.

* **Component Testing with Karma \+ Jasmine:** DOM interactions.

* **Mini Project 4:** Test **Pricing Service** logic with Jest and validate **Calendar Component** rendering with Karma.

* **Prompt recipes:**  
  * "Generate Jest tests for calculateBookingPrice covering tax/discount edge cases."

  * "Write Karma test ensuring availability calendar renders correct cells."

* **Deliverables:** 80%+ coverage achieved, tests automated in CI.

### **Day 6: End-to-End Testing with Playwright — critical user journeys**

* Configure Playwright for Angular.

* Write E2E scripts for login, navigation, booking.

* **Mini Project 5:** Automate **Reservation Flow** (login → book room → confirmation toast).

* **Prompt recipes:**

  * "Write a Playwright script to login as frontdesk and create a new reservation."

* **Deliverables:** E2E tests run across browsers; flows stable.

### **Day 7: Debugging & Refactoring with Copilot — bug-hunt \+ optimization**

* Debugging with Copilot: logs, stack traces, hypotheses, fixes.

* Repo-wide refactoring for modularization, DI improvements, lazy loading.

* **Mini Project 6:** Debug seeded bugs in **Order Service**, refactor **Cart Module**.

* **Prompt recipes:**

  * "Analyze this stack trace and propose a minimal fix with tests."

  * "Refactor cart module to support lazy loading and caching."

* **Deliverables:** Bugs resolved, performance improved, PR merged.

### **Day 8: AI-Driven Code Reviews & PR Automation**

* Copilot auto-reviews PRs: anti-patterns, accessibility, performance.

* Generate changelogs, release notes.

* **Mini Project 7:** Submit a PR for **Payment Gateway Integration**, Copilot reviews & optimizes.

* **Prompt recipes:**

  * "Summarize PR changes, list risks, suggest tests."

* **Deliverables:** PR approved with automated Copilot reviews.

### 

### **Day 9: Group Project 2 — Advanced Feature Build**
