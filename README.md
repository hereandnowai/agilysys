# HERE AND NOW AI – Agilysys Copilot Training

Welcome to the Agilysys Copilot Training repository! This program is a 40-hour, 100% hands-on training designed to make you proficient in AI-driven software development with GitHub Copilot.

## Program Overview

Over the course of 10 days (4 hours per day), you will engage in practical exercises covering the entire development lifecycle, from scaffolding and feature implementation to testing, debugging, and refactoring—all with the assistance of GitHub Copilot.

## Navigating the Modules

The training is divided into six modules, each in its own folder:

*   **`angularjs-copilot-training-app/`**: The main project for the first two weeks.
*   **`copilot-labs-prompts/`**: Learn to write effective prompts.
*   **`copilot-refactor-examples/`**: Practice refactoring legacy code.
*   **`copilot-unit-tests-generation/`**: Generate unit tests with AI.
*   **`copilot-debugging-lab/`**: Debug code with Copilot's help.
*   **`copilot-pr-review-lab/`**: Use AI for code reviews.

Each folder contains a `README.md` with specific instructions and an `exercise.js` or `exercise.html` file to get you started.

## Getting Started with Copilot

To follow along with the exercises, you will need:

1.  **GitHub Copilot**: Make sure you have the GitHub Copilot extension installed and enabled in Visual Studio Code.
2.  **Copilot Chat**: The Copilot Chat extension is also essential for interactive assistance.

Throughout the training, you will be prompted to use both inline Copilot suggestions and the Copilot Chat interface to complete the exercises.
